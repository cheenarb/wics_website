                    <p class = "lead"> Code the Change helps computer scientists use their skills for social change. We believe that social change should be an integral part of computer science culture, and that this is often forgotten in the rush of campus culture. We connect students to nonprofits that need their help, lead code jams for nonprofit work, and maintain a campus community for discussing the social impact of computer science.

                    <p class = "lead"> she++ is a nonprofit that seeks to dismantle the untrue sterotype that computer science is not a career for women. We work with the technology industry to create a culture that is more appealing to women, and we work with young women across the globe to dismantle harmful perceptions that they cannot succeed in the technology industry. Our outreach includes an annual fellowship for high school students, an ambassador program for college students, and the creation of online videos and campaigns. We are rebranding technology to be less about the stereotypes, and more about the problem-solving, the building, and the impact. By tackling the source of these stereotypes, we hope to create a field where women feel included, respected, and valued. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit run by Stanford undergraduate students. </p>
